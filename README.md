# Portfolio
30/10/2020

After a couple of month of learning HTML and CSS from the scratch and managed to get the "Responsive Web Design Certification" on FreeCode Camp.

This is my fist attemp to build a porfolio using only HTML CSS on Visual Studio Code ( I might decide to include some bootstrap as sson as I lern it  well )

Thank you
